              React is a JavaScript library for building use interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook,
              Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations. React can be used in th
              development of single-page applications and mobile applications. It aims primarily to provide
              speed, simplicity, and scalability. As a user interface library, React is often used in
              conjunction with other libraries such as Redux.

              <h4>Redux-Thunk</h4>
              <p>
                Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of
                an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a
                certain condition is met.

              <h4>Higher order components</h4>
              <p>
                A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic.
                HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s
                compositional nature.
